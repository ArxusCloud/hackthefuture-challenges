## Instructions for Jill

Hey Jill! This source code is the Bridges Paper Website.
The website is written in NodeJS and uses the Angular framework.

Today you will learn to deploy it to Azure.
You do not have to alter anything besides a single file.
So go ahead and fill in your team's number in the `hackthefuture.ts` file. This is required for making sure you can progress.

```js
export const team = {
  teamId: '12345',
};

```

Do not forget to *commit* and *push* your changes as mentioned in the readme.md in the root of this repository.
In case you have not yet git before, you will get the following error message: `Author identity unknown
*** Please tell me who you are.`

Fix this by opening the terminal in vscode (ctrl + \`) and paste the following commands

```ps
Run
  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Find a way to deploy this website via [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
Make sure you login with the credentials that were provided on the HackTheFuture website.
Visit the website when finished to confirm that it looks ok.
Note, Patience is key!
