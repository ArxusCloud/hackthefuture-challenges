Anger. Sadness. Fear. Despair and hopefully… Hope. <br/><br/>We implore you to focus on hope, as hope is the only force powerful enough to make the survival of our species possible… Jill and Bill Bridges were recently invited by Prince Larry and Meghan Sparkle to join them at their estate in Leicester. The reason for this rather unexpected invitation was not conveyed, however rumours had it it was to congratulate them on their efforts to reduce global emissions with their green Azure datacenters. Nothing could have been further from the truth. Immediately after observing all formalities, Larry and Meghan invited Jill and Bill to a private room, where not even security personnel was permitted. It was in this room, where they told the Bridges couple a story that would change their lives, and that of everyone on this planet. “My grandmother-in-law has been contacted by extraterrestrials”, Sparkle exclaimed. <br/><br/>“Yes”, Larry continued, “The Queen has been contacted by an alien civilization, a reptilian-like species who call themselves Duolunians. They are miles ahead of us when it comes to technology and it appears the can communicate telepathically over interstellar distances, using the higher dimensions we as humans are yet to unlock. They told my grandmother that they had been watching our planet with great interest for a long time. Planets like ours are extremely rare in the universe, the sparks of life are scarce in the cosmos and to their society, the preservation of such a spark is the highest commandment they know. They would go through any length to preserve life on a planet, even to destroy one of the species who live there. As species like us, humans. Jill interrupted and asked: “When was she contacted?” “22 years ago”, Larry said. </p><p> “Then why didn’t you say anything up till now?”, Bill asked with a critical look on his face. Larry answered: “Because at first, the Queen having the age she has, we couldn’t believe this ourselves and wanted to see if we could verify this. For the past 22 years we have been scanning the cosmos for any signs of an alien invasion, and last month we found it. Near Alpha Centauri, our closest star at 4 lightyears, we detected stripe-like patterns going through a dust cloud, pointing in our direction. From the refraction pattern, we can tell the objects must have been moving at 53% light speed. There’s no doubt this is the Duolunian fleet, and it exists of at least 1200 ships. Unable to believe what she just heard, Jill uttered: “Are you saying that we are all doomed?” “We have been given a deadline. <br/><br/>If we can turn ourselves around and start healing our planet and its ecosystem instead of destroying it, we will have proven that we are not a threat to all life on Earth and they will leave us be.” “So 4 lightyears, traveling at about 50%, that makes 8 years to fix our planet before these lizards kill us all?”, Bill said. “I’m afraid not”, Sparkle jumped in. “The light from the dust cloud took 4 years to reach our detector, which means there’s only 4 years of travel left for their fleet. According to our most recent calculations, they will arrive here at 14/10/2025.” Since that visit with in Leicester, Jill and Bill have been working incessantly to contact every influential person on this planet to aid in the fight for survival of our species and started the Bridges Foundation. We believe everyone has the right to know what is going on, so we publish this article hoping that you all understand the challenge that has been laid out before us. We encourage every single person on this planet to use everything within their power to make sure we start changing this planet for the better and ensure the survival of mankind. <br/> <br/> Stay hopeful, The Bridges Foundation </p></div></div></article> <br><br><br><br><section id="trailer" class="section"> <div class="c-video"> <div class="c-video__content"> <iframe title="video" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/545393027" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" class="c-video__source" ></iframe> </div></div></section> <br><br><article class="u-stack-4 u-stack-8@7" *ngIf="showNext"> <div class="u-stack-4"> <h2></h2> <h1 class="u-stack-4"> <span class="u-typo-h1-base u-text-background"> Artists4Earth: 25/12/2021 </span> </h1> </div><p class="u-typo-p-large u-text-underline u-text-justify"></p><div class="c-read-more is-closed"> <div class="u-grid u-gap u-cols-1 u-cols-2@7 u-text-justify"> <p> When desperate times arrive, music can often bring comfort and hope. In the spirit of Live Aid, we have created our once-in-a-lifetime music festival to raise funds and awareness so we can unite to avert the oncoming disaster we are facing. <br><br>When we contacted artists around the world, almost everyone was excited and wanted to participate.
